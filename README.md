# Brain Booster
Brain booster is a customizable memory game, 100% free and open-source. Play one of the pre-defined games, or play a custom game created by you or a friend! You can create your own memory game by choosing photos from your phone.

"Brain Booster" is the classic picture matching game - find pairs of matching cards that start face down. It’s fun for all ages and a great way to exercise your brain and improve your concentration. The app is ad-free with a clean interface.

Features:
* Choose from various board sizes: 4 x 2, 6 x 3, and 6 x 4
* Play with colorful icons in the default mode
* Customize the game with pictures on your phone, and then share your personalized game with other friends/family who have the app - they can play your game!
* Easily track the number of moves you’ve made and the number of pairs you’ve found.

You can play the game with some default icons, or play with your own game by adding your own photos. After you create your own game, share it with others by sending them the unique game name. Backstory: this app started out much simpler, but I added more features and decided to turn the project into a free step-by-step guide about building an Android app! I hope you enjoy it.
